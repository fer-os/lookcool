# lookcool
Use this if you want to look cool to people
- Please note that I don't care if it doesn't look like what you normally see. It's supposed to be exactly 420 characters.

## Usage
- Add `lookcool.sh` to your directory (it doesn't matter which one)
- Run `chmod u+x ./lookcool.sh`
- Run `./lookcool.sh`

## Features
it spams a bunch of random 1s and 0s but doesn't actually do anything

enjoy messing with people
